"""Drop an `IN (...)` CHECK constraint on one column, on either dialect.

Migration 079 did this for `vehicles.vehicle_type` inline; 128 (tax types)
and later ones need the same for other tables, so the mechanics live here.
Under `app/utils/` and not beside the migrations: the runner imports every
module in `app/migrations/` as a migration.

PostgreSQL: the constraint is found by its definition (so its name does not
matter) and dropped with ALTER TABLE.

SQLite has no in-place CHECK drop, so the table is rebuilt the way 079 does
it: the live CREATE TABLE is read from sqlite_master, the CHECK clause is
stripped (with the comma it strands repaired), and the table is recreated,
filled, swapped in and re-indexed inside one transaction with foreign keys
off, then `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` must come back clean before commit.
With foreign keys off, dropping the old table cascades to nothing, which is
what makes this safe on an FK parent.

Idempotent: a table without the CHECK is left alone.
